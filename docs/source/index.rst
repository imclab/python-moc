Python Music On Console
=======================
*Python Music On Console* is a wrapper over the amazing console music player
moc_. It currently consist of two modules:

.. _moc: http://moc.daper.net

A mocp Python interface
-----------------------
The :mod:`moc` package wraps the ``mocp`` console interface and provides
an API to all actions listed in ``mocp --help``.

   moc


An event system based on the interface
--------------------------------------
The :mod:`moc.event` module is a tiny and dynamic event system based on
the :mod:`moc` package. It makes you able to execute callbacks when moc
changed for instance the currently played track.

Bugs, feature requests and current development version
------------------------------------------------------
Python MOC uses github_ as version control system and bug tracker and so on.

You can get the current development version from github_ using :command:`git clone`::

    git clone git://github.com/jonashaag/python-moc

Please file bugs and feature requests using the `github ticket system`_.

I'm glad to get any kind of feedback! (critics, thanks, ideas, feature requests, blah)
